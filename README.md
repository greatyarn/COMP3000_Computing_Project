## Project Vision

The QTrobot is a toddler-like humanoid robot built by LuxAI. This project, Audio
Authentication via Voice Recognition on QTrobot, or AAVR for short, is a software for
patients who would like to allow for an easy way to authenticate themselves through
robots with the use of their voice. This authentication process with the use of a human
voice allows for patients to retrieve their medical records, which might contain their
age, height, and weight. This method of authenticating by voice is safer and more
convenient as it reduces the amount of human interaction that is needed, therefore
allowing for an improvement of personal data security as a whole. With voice
authentication, this allows for multiple different patient profiles to be set up
conveniently.
